<p>
Minnow Proxy(s) is a place for EOS guppies to school together and get our voice heard.  We are not concerned with voting for the TOP 21 Witness/Block-Producers,,,,, NO, our goal is to get as many small Block-Producers into a paid position as possible (more than a 0.05% vote).</P>
<p>
For the safety of the EOS Network, it is advantages to have as many paid BP's as possible,,, that way many systems are maintained to a high level so that any emergency with the TOP 21 can easily be adapted to on the fly.</p>

<p>
With just a few thousands of EOS tokens delegating their VOTES to Minnow Proxy(s) will start moving BP's into paid positions.</p>
<p>
The WHALES and SHARKS have their positions secured in the TOP 21.  Us minnows need to be looking out for "the little guy" producers.<br>  SCHOOL THE SHARKS!!!</p>
